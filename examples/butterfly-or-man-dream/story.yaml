# Once Zhuangzi dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering
# around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was
# Zhuangzi. Suddenly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable
# Zhuangzi. But he didn't know if he was Zhuangzi who had dreamt he was a
# butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuangzi. Between Zhuangzi and a
# butterfly there must be some distinction! This is called the Transformation
# of Things. (2, tr. Burton Watson 1968:49)
