  - room-key: h
    name: courtyard
    description: > 
        You are in an indoor courtyard. The ceiling is glass, so there
        is a great deal of light that enters the room. What's more, the room is
        made more interesting by the fact that the doorways to the adjoining 
        rooms are all at the corners of the courtyard, not against the walls 
        like the other rooms of this house. Very peculiar... and somehow,  
        mysterious.
  - room-key: m
    name: exciting room
    description: > 
        You are in an exciting room. For some reason, you get butterflies in
        your stomach and begin to laugh. You try to suppress it, but do not
        succeed. This room is just too exciting.

  - room-key: n
    name: wonderful room
    description: >
        You are in a wonderful room. Though you cannot explain your reaction by
        examining the simple decorations, you find yourself reminded of
        pyramids, hanging gardens, and lighthouses.

  - room-key: o
    name: fascinating room
    description: >
        You are in a fascinating room. Each little nondescript nothing here
        creates endless thoughts in your head. You'd better leave soon, or you
        could end up fascinating yourself to death.

  - room-key: p
    name: terrific key
    description: You are in a terrific room. Dunno why. It's just terrific.

  - room-key: r
    name: no escape
    description: >
        Oh no! You notice too late that the door you just passed through is a
        magical one-way door, an infamous one-way Valve of Doom. You begin
        going through your inventory to catalog your edible resources. After
        that, you're going to do some math and estimate how many days you have
        left, for they are most certainly numbered.

  - room-key: s
    name: room of denial
    description: You are in the Room of Denial. You cannot go back.

  - room-key: t
    name: room of anger

    name: room of bargaining
    description: You are in the Room of Bargaining. You can still not go back.

  - room-key: v
    name: room of sorrow
    description: >
        You are in the Room of Sorrow. Hey! You can -- oh, wait. Never mind.
        You can't go back.

  - room-key: w
    name: room of acceptance
    description: >
        You are in the Room of Acceptance. Oddly, having come to terms with the
        fact that this chain of rooms with their one-way doors could go on
        forever, you find out something quite to the contrary: they have
        circled back to the courtyard... you see it just beyond the next door.
        You sigh with relief and anticipation when you see that startlingly
        bright room.

  - room-key: q
    name: quicksand
    description: You are sinking in quicksand... you're dead."
