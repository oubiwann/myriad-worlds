Myriad Worlds
=============

Background
----------

This code is based on the `adventure engine <>`_ that `Paul McGuire<>`_, the
author of `PyParsing <>`_, wrote and then summarized for a `PyCon 2006 talk
<>`_. The first revision in myriad-worlds repository is his work, 100%.

Vision
------

Each subsequent revision since then has aimed to expand Paul's original work
into something that could support an experiment in authoring interactive
fiction adventure games. The initial thrust of this experimentation was:

* object- or connection-based storyline generation (as opposed to room-based)
  but this quickly expanded into exploring the following:

  * ASCII maps generated from textual descriptions

  * procedurally generated floor plans, city plans, landscapes, etc.

  * how to abstract a world and the narration of its contents in a way amenable
    to generating new stories from rearranged content

Ultimately, the intent of this project is to be able to create interesting
games that are infinitely replayable, due to the variation that is possible.
