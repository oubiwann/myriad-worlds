As one might imagine, I have pages and pages of hand-written notes. I'll only
transfer them to this TODO file when I plan on working on noted features in
the "near" future (i.e., next up on the list).

* Add save/restore game functionality.
  - add LOAD command
  - add SAVE command

* Add support for rooms containing rooms (e.g., a "city" object that could
  contain many "building" objects, which could each contain many "room"
  objects).

* Add readline support (in particular, command history) for the interpreter.

* Work on defining terrain data and auto-populating a new world with tiles of
  different terrain types.

* Adjust the API so that it's testable (e.g., convert print statements to print
  methods that simply print the results of various actions, and then use the
  methods that generated the results in tests... to do things like play the
  game programmatically).

* The Cave terrain class was removed. Instead, an attirbute needs to be added
  to terrain objects to indicate the liklihood of a cave occurring on that
  tile.

* I've started thinking about the rules for fine-tuning the placement of tiles,
  and under what circumstances one tile can be next to another (in addition to
  valid transitions). This work needs to continue with the addition of
  supporting logic in the util.getRandomTileTransitionClass function.
