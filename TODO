As one might imagine, I have pages and pages of hand-written notes. I'll only
transfer them to this TODO file when I plan on working on noted features in
the "near" future (i.e., next up on the list).

* Add save/restore game functionality.
  - add LOAD command
  - add SAVE command

* Add support for rooms containing rooms (e.g., a "city" object that could
  contain many "building" objects, which could each contain many "room"
  objects).

* Add readline support (in particular, command history) for the interpreter.

* Work on defining terrain data and auto-populating a new world with tiles of
  different terrain types.
