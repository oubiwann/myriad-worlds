# Human perceptual average distance to horizon on Earth, in miles; this is
# taken as the unit size of a tile. To provide some reference, a small town of
# 3000 people can easily fit in 2 square miles (that's about 1300 residential
# buildings). So a single tile will provide pleny of space for a small town.
# 
# On the other extreme, a large city can be in the neighborhood of 500 square
# miles (e.g., New York City) with a population density of 28,000 people per
# square mile (which would be 84000 people per tile). A city the size of NYC
# would require about 150 tiles, a grid of 10 by 15 tiles.
